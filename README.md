# Features
* Plenty of exercises such as Yoga, Situps, Pushups, Weights, Chins/pull-ups, Bicycle exercise (rental).
* In order to exercise you need to purchase the gym membership in the gym menu.
* After you've done an exercise there'll be a cooldown for 60 seconds which means you can't do any exercise for 60 seconds.
* A gym shop where you can purchase: water, sportlunch, protein shake, Powerade & bandage.
* Business hours, pretty much it just prints that the gym is open 24hrs/ day.
* Before any exercise the script will ALWAYS doublecheck if the player actually has a membership or not, if the player needs to rest or not and if the player already is training or not etc.
* The script doesn't really take too much CPU usage, I've never received a script warning from ESX_GYM.
